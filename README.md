# _Doctor_Search_

#### _Implementing API and Asynchrony in JavaScript, 10.20.2017_

#### By _Michael A. Brooks_

## Description

_Create an app using an API call to BetterDoctor to search for medical providing by user's medical issues or by doctor name._

## Specs

* _A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query._
* _A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query._
* _If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data)._
* _If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is._
* _If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. _clone project from GitHub.com_
2. _in project directory via terminal run:_
* _npm install_
* _bower install_
* _gulp build_
